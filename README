This is a basic web application for displaying a picture of my dog's doghouse
via off-the-shelf webcam using the webcam package for ubuntu. The dot-webcamrc
file contains parameters that cause my webcam to work.

The html, css, and javascript simply display the image and update the image
source every 5 seconds.
